# My neovim config

This config is for my linux use only. It is the successor after [Cynosure](https://github.com/bryant-the-coder/Cynosure)

### Core

I have a `core` folder in which files for things like autocommands, setting, plugins or utils are.

### Modules folder

In this folder is where I keep all my plugins config
e.g. completion, editor, files, lang, lsp, tools, ui

### Custom

All my custom settings eg. dashboard, statusline and winbar
I override my colors in this folder

## CREDITS

Thanks to these wonderful people. Their config guided me into making my config.
